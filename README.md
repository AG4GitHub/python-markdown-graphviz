### Python-Markdown-Graphviz

The goal of this library is to support embedding graphviz graphs inside
Markdown documents.

Requires:

   * Python (tested on 2.5, 2.6, not sure about 2.4 off hand)
   * Graphviz
       * ubuntu: ``apt-get install``
       * others: download at [graphviz.org](graphviz.org)
   * Python-Markdown
       * ``easy_install Markdown``

Read the ``examples/example.py`` for a simple example.

I'll link to a blog post with more details once I write it.
